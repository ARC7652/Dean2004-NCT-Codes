Regardless, it seems like the election is destined to go to the state delegations and the Senate, where the Republican Party hold a commanding majority, meaning that, save for a recount changing the results in a close red state, Bush and Cheney are nearly ensured re-election. Democrats are disheartened at the fact that an election once thought to be unwinnable has slipped through their grasps in the most painful way imaginable.</p><p>After the mess caused by this whole ordeal, something even more extreme than the happenings of 4 years ago, it’s more than likely that there will be a serious push by Democrats to pass a constitutional amendment similar to Bayh–Celler that would abolish the Electoral College, but you know that Bush and the GOP will likely stop it from passing in either chamber anyhow.</p><p>The tied nature of this race has led to much speculation about what 2008 holds for both parties as well. On the Republican side, Bill Frist and Rudy Giuliani seem to be the frontrunners, as Cheney has refused to toss his hat in the ring, whereas the Democrats seem increasingly likely to nominate Hillary Clinton. The past few months, however, have demonstrated that nothing is set in stone. Maybe you could influence the party to nominate a more liberal candidate, or even make another run for it yourself in 4 years? Regardless, that can wait.</p><p> Now, get ready for the months of legal battles and mudslinging, because American politics is about to become a lot more heated thanks to this.</p>"

Speculation around 2008 candidates has already commenced; due to your heavy loss, Hillary Clinton, leader of the moderate wing of the party, is practically assured the Democratic nomination should she run for it. Maybe it truly does take a Clinton to beat the Republican Party these days.

Roman poets place them on some small islands called ‘‘Sirenum scopuli’’. In some later, rationalized traditions, the literal geography of the ‘‘flowery’’ island of Anthemoessa, or Anthemusa, is fixed: sometimes on Cape Pelorum and at others in the islands known as the Sirenuse, near Paestum, or in Capreae. All such locations were surrounded by cliffs and rocks.</p><p>This is why no one could have foreseen one appearing in America.</p><p>The first recorded individual of the species, a supposed white male from Vermont calling itself ‘‘Howard Brush Dean III’’, first became of public interest in 1991, when it became Governor of the state following the death of his predecessor, Richard A. Snelling, by a supposed heart attack. Serving in the office until 2003, the creature later mounted a campaign to become the next President of the United States. This is when it first demonstrated its full power.</p><p>On January 19th, 2004, following his victory in the Iowa Caucus, the entity unleashed a sonic rallying cry to his supporters, instantly entrancing them. The cry would be covered on news station after news station; exactly as planned. Soon, the entire country, and a significant portion of the world, was under its control.</p><p>Instead of leading them to their deaths, however, ‘‘Dean’’ would use his powers to win. And win. And win again. The 22nd Amendment was repealed unanimously, to let the entity continue running for President. The Senate and House were both abolished. The entire government of the United States was soon disbanded, in favor of reforming the nation into the First American Empire, with Dean as its Emperor.</p><p>And yet, that was only the beginning.</p>";
